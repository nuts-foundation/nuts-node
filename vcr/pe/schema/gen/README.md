# generate structs from JSON schema

From this directory, run:

```shell
go run .
```

It'll generate `generated.go` within the `pe` package.
The generated code is not really useful, but it could serve as a guide for the types that are expected by the API.
The output of `generated.go` is copied to `types.go`
