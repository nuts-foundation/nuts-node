This test can be executed against multiple SQL databases.
It's executed (by running `./run-test.sh`) on all supported databases (postgres, sqlite, mysql) by default.
To perform the test on a specific database, run `./do-test.sh <database>` where `<database>` is one of the supported databases (postgres, sqlite, mysql).
