type RFC8414Fields struct {
	Issuer string `json:"issuer"`
	//	REQUIRED.  The authorization server's issuer identifier, which is
	//	a URL that uses the "https" scheme and has no query or fragment
	//	components.  Authorization server metadata is published at a
	//	location that is ".well-known" according to RFC 5785 [RFC5785]
	//	derived from this issuer identifier, as described in Section 3.
	//	The issuer identifier is used to prevent authorization server mix-
	//	up attacks, as described in "OAuth 2.0 Mix-Up Mitigation"
	//[MIX-UP].

	AuthorizationEndpoint url.URL `json:"authorization_endpoint"`
	//	URL of the authorization server's authorization endpoint
	//[RFC6749].  This is REQUIRED unless no grant types are supported
	//	that use the authorization endpoint.

	TokenEndpoint url.URL `json:"token_endpoint"`
	//URL of the authorization server's token endpoint [RFC6749].  This
	//is REQUIRED unless only the implicit grant type is supported.

	JwksURI url.URL `json:"jwks_uri"`
	//OPTIONAL.  URL of the authorization server's JWK Set [JWK]
	//document.  The referenced document contains the signing key(s) the
	//client uses to validate signatures from the authorization server.
	//This URL MUST use the "https" scheme.  The JWK Set MAY also
	//contain the server's encryption key or keys, which are used by
	//clients to encrypt requests to the server.  When both signing and
	//encryption keys are made available, a "use" (public key use)
	//parameter value is REQUIRED for all keys in the referenced JWK Set
	//to indicate each key's intended usage.

	//OPTIONAL.  URL of the authorization server's OAuth 2.0 Dynamic
	//Client Registration endpoint [RFC7591].

	// NOTE: If added, should this be configurable or hardcoded?

	// but that also requires configuration per care organization. Sounds like too much complexity for now.
	ScopesSupported []string `json:"scopes_supported"`
	//	RECOMMENDED.  JSON array containing a list of the OAuth 2.0
	//[RFC6749] "scope" values that this authorization server supports.

	//			and thus are transmitted via the HTTP POST method to the Client, with the result parameters being encoded in the body using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format.
	//			The action attribute of the form MUST be the Client's Redirection URI. The method of the form attribute MUST be POST.
	//			Because the Authorization Response is intended to be used only once,
	//			the Authorization Server MUST instruct the User Agent (and any intermediaries) not to store or reuse the content of the response.
	// From https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html#name-response-mode-direct_post

	//			In this mode, the Authorization Response is sent to the Verifier using an HTTPS POST request to an endpoint controlled by the Verifier.
	//			The Authorization Response parameters are encoded in the body using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded content type.
	//			The flow can end with an HTTPS POST request from the Wallet to the Verifier, or it can end with a redirect that follows the HTTPS POST request,
	//			if the Verifier responds with a redirect URI to the Wallet.

	//REQUIRED	URL of the authorization server's JWK Set document. Must start with client_id.
