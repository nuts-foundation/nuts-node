// bfsWalkerAlgorithm walks the DAG using the Breadth-First-Search (BFS) as described by Anany Levitin in "The Design & Analysis of Algorithms".
// It visits the whole tree level for level (breadth first vs depth first). It works by taking a node from queue and
// then adds the node's children (downward edges) to the queue. It starts by adding the root node to the queue and
// loops over the queue until empty, meaning all nodes reachable from the root node have been visited. Since our
// DAG contains merges (two parents referring to the same child node) we also keep a map to avoid visiting a
// merger node twice.
//
// This also means we have to make sure we don't visit the merger node before all of its previous nodes have been
// visited, which BFS doesn't account for. If that happens we skip the node without marking it as visited,
// so it will be visited again when the unvisited previous node is visited, which re-adds the merger node to the queue.
//
// In addition, when the visitor stops the walking (by returning false), it breaks off the walking for that specific branch of the DAG.
//
// It is also stateful: it remembers which documents were visited and where to resume walking next time it is invoked.
// This is useful for subscriptions: the first time the DAG is walked all documents are processed, keeping track of
// which branches couldn't be processed (payload might be missing, so it has to be processed layer). Next time the
// walker is invoked it starts walking at the documents in the `resumeAt` list and ultimately honoring the `startAt`
// hash.
