Dependencies
************

This projects is using go modules, so version > 1.12 is recommended. 1.10 would be a minimum.

Running tests
*************

Tests can be run by executing

.. code-block:: shell

    go test ./...

Building
********

Just use ``go build``.

The server and client API is generated from the open-api spec:

.. code-block:: shell

    make gen-api

Generating Mocks
****************

These mocks are used by other modules

.. code-block:: shell

	make gen-mocks
README
******

The readme is auto-generated from a template and uses the documentation to fill in the blanks.

.. code-block:: shell

    make gen-readme

This script uses ``rst_include`` which is installed as part of the dependencies for generating the documentation.

Documentation
*************

To generate the documentation, you'll need python3, sphinx and a bunch of other stuff.
The documentation can be build by running

.. code-block:: shell

    /docs $ make html

Requirements for running sphinx
===============================

  - install python3
  - install pip3 (if it doesn't install automatically)
  - ``pip3 install sphinx``
  - ``pip3 install recommonmark``
  - ``pip3 install sphinx_rtd_theme``
  - ``pip3 install rst_include``
  - ``pip3 install sphinx-jsonschema``
  - ``pip3 install sphinxcontrib-httpdomain``

Configuration
*************

The Nuts-go library contains some configuration logic which allows for usage of configFiles, Environment variables and commandLine params transparently.
If a Nuts engine is added as Engine it'll automatically work for the given engine. It is also possible for an engine to add the capabilities on a standalone basis.
This allows for testing from within a repo.

The parameters follow the following convention:
``$ nuts --parameter X`` is equal to ``$ NUTS_PARAMETER=X nuts`` is equal to ``parameter: X`` in a yaml file.

Or for this piece of yaml

.. code-block:: yaml

    nested:
        parameter: X

is equal to ``$ nuts --nested.parameter X`` is equal to ``$ NUTS_NESTED_PARAMETER=X nuts``

Config parameters for engines are prepended by the ``engine.ConfigKey`` by default (configurable):

.. code-block:: yaml

    engine:
        nested:
            parameter: X

is equal to ``$ nuts --engine.nested.parameter X`` is equal to ``$ NUTS_ENGINE_NESTED_PARAMETER=X nuts``


Options
*******

The following options can be configured:

.. marker-for-config-options

.. include:: options.rst
