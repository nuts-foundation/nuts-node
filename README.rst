#########

Distributed registry for storing and querying health care providers their vendors and technical endpoints.

See the `documentation <https://nuts-node.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for how to set up, integrate and use the Nuts node.

Hello, World!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The simplest way to spin up the Nuts stack is by using the setup provided by `nuts-network-local <https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-network-local>`_.
The setup is meant for development purposes and starts a Nuts node, "Demo EHR", "Registry Admin Demo" for administering your vendor and care organizations and a HAPI server to exchange FHIR data.

To get started, clone the repository and run the following commands to start the stack:

.. code-block:: shell

    cd single
    docker compose pull
    docker compose up

After the services have started you can try the following endpoints:

- `Nuts Node status page <http://localhost:1323/status/diagnostics>`_.
- `Registry Admin Demo login <http://localhost:1303/>`_ (default password: "demo").
- `Demo EHR login <http://localhost:1304/>`_ (default password: "demo").

Development
^^^^^^^^^^^

Building
********

Just use ``go build``.

Building for exotic environments
================================

You can build and run the Nuts node on more exotic environments, e.g. Raspberry Pis:

* 32-bit ARMv6 (Raspberry Pi Zero): ``env GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=6 go build``

Running tests
*************

Tests can be run by executing

.. code-block:: shell

    go test ./...

Code Generation
***************

Code generation is used for generating mocks, OpenAPI client- and servers, and gRPC services.
Make sure that ``GOPATH/bin`` is available on ``PATH`` and that the dependencies are installed

Install ``protoc``:

  | MacOS: ``brew install protobuf``
  | Linux: ``apt install -y protobuf-compiler``

Install Go tools:

.. code-block:: shell

  make install-tools

Generating code:

To regenerate all code run the ``run-generators`` target from the makefile or use one of the following for a specific group

================ =======================
Group            Command
================ =======================
Mocks            ``make gen-mocks``
OpenApi          ``make gen-api``
Protobuf + gRCP  ``make gen-protobuf``
All              ``make run-generators``
================ =======================

README
======

The readme is auto-generated from a template and uses the documentation to fill in the blanks.

.. code-block:: shell

    make gen-readme

Documentation
=============

The documentation can be build by running the following command from the ``/docs`` directory:

.. code-block:: shell

    make html

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Nuts node can be configured using a YAML configuration file, environment variables and commandline params.

The parameters follow the following convention:
``$ nuts --parameter X`` is equal to ``$ NUTS_PARAMETER=X nuts`` is equal to ``parameter: X`` in a yaml file.

Or for this piece of yaml

.. code-block:: yaml

    nested:
        parameter: X

is equal to ``$ nuts --nested.parameter X`` is equal to ``$ NUTS_NESTED_PARAMETER=X nuts``

Config parameters for engines are prepended by the ``engine.ConfigKey`` by default (configurable):

.. code-block:: yaml

    engine:
        nested:
            parameter: X

is equal to ``$ nuts --engine.nested.parameter X`` is equal to ``$ NUTS_ENGINE_NESTED_PARAMETER=X nuts``

While most options are a single value, some are represented as a list (indicated with the square brackets in the table below).
To provide multiple values through flags or environment variables you can separate them with a comma (``var1,var2``).
If you need to provide an actual value with a comma, you can escape it with a backslash (``\,``) to avoid it having split into multiple values.

Ordering
********

Command line parameters have the highest priority, then environment variables, then parameters from the configfile and lastly defaults.
The location of the configfile is determined by the environment variable ``NUTS_CONFIGFILE`` or the commandline parameter ``--configfile``. If both are missing the default location ``./nuts.yaml`` is used. ::

    CLI > ENV > Config File > Defaults

Server options
**************

The following options can be configured on the server:

.. marker-for-config-options

.. table:: Server Options
    :widths: 20 30 50
    :class: options-table

These are node-to-node (/n2n) endpoints, but only the base path up until (not including) /n2n has to be configured. So typically, only a domain. Must be HTTPS when strict-mode is enabled.

This table is automatically generated using the configuration flags in the core and engines. When they're changed
the options table must be regenerated using the Makefile:

Secrets
*******

All options ending with ``token`` or ``password`` are considered secrets and can only be set through environment variables or the config file.

Strict mode
***********

Several of the server options above allow the node to be configured in a way that is unsafe for production environments, but are convenient for testing or development.
The node can be configured to run in strict mode (default) to prevent any insecure configurations.
Below is a summary of the impact ``strictmode=true`` has on the node and its configuration.

Save storage of any private key material requires some serious consideration.
For this reason the ``crypto.storage`` backend must explicitly be set.

Private transactions can only be exchanged over authenticated nodes.
Therefore strict mode requires ``network.enabletls=true``, and the certificate chain ``tls.{certfile,certkeyfile,truststore}`` must be provided.
To verify that authentication is correctly configured on your node, check the ``network.auth_config`` status on the ``/health`` endpoint.
See :ref:`getting started <configure-node>` on how to set this up correctly.

The incorporated `IRMA server <https://irma.app/docs/irma-server/#production-mode>`_ is automatically changed to production mode.
In fact, running in strict mode is the only way to enable IRMA's production mode.
In addition, it requires ``auth.irma.schememanager=pbdf`` and the ``auth.publicurl`` where the IRMA client can reach the server must be set.

As a general safety precaution ``auth.contractvalidators`` ignores the ``dummy`` option if configured,
requesting an access token from another node on ``/n2n/auth/v1/accesstoken`` does not return any error details,
``auth.accesstokenlifespan`` is always 60 seconds, ``http.default.cors.origin`` does not allow a wildcard (``*``),
json-ld context can only be downloaded from trusted domains configured in ``jsonld.contexts.remoteallowlist``,
and the ``internalratelimiter`` is always on.

Interacting with remote Nuts nodes requires HTTPS: it will refuse to connect to plain HTTP endpoints when in strict mode.

CLI options
^^^^^^^^^^^

The following options can be supplied when running CLI commands:

.. table:: Client Options
    :widths: 20 30 50
    :class: options-table

    ==========      ==============      =====================================================================================================================================================================
    Key             Default             Description
    ==========      ==============      =====================================================================================================================================================================
    address         localhost:1323      Address of the node. Must contain at least host and port, URL scheme may be omitted. In that case it 'http://' is prepended.
    timeout         10s                 Client time-out when performing remote operations, such as '500ms' or '10s'. Refer to Golang's 'time.Duration' syntax for a more elaborate description of the syntax.
    token                               Token to be used for authenticating on the remote node. Takes precedence over 'token-file'.
    token-file                          File from which the authentication token will be read. If not specified it will try to read the token from the '.nuts-client.cfg' file in the user's home dir.
    verbosity       info                Log level (trace, debug, info, warn, error)
