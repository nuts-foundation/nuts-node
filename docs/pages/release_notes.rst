*******************
Peanut (v6 alpha 1)
*******************

**Release date:** TBD
**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-node/compare/v5.0.0...master

New Features
************

The following new features have been added:

- Resolving and creating ``did:web`` DID documents (see the VDR v2 API reference for usage).
- Resolving ``did:jwk`` and ``did:key`` DID documents.
- Running a Discovery Server and Client (see :ref:`discovery`)
- Added a Verifiable Credential system-wallet, which is used in Presentation Exchanges (e.g. OpenID4VP).
  See the VCR API reference for usage.
- Added support for OpenID4VP (OpenID for Verifiable Presentations)
- Added support for Nuts RFC021, which negotiates an OAuth2 access token for a system through a Presentation Exchange using Verifiable Credentials.
- Added support for `StatusList2021 <https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/WD-vc-status-list-20230427/>`_ as revocation means for Verifiable Credentials.

Changes
*******

- Removed support for deprecated network TLS properties. Configuring these properties will now cause the node not to start.
- Removed usage of deprecated `purposeOfUseClaim` in ``NutsAuthorizationCredential``.
- Removed support for the UZI authentication means.
- Documentation of ``did:nuts``-related features have been removed (refer to v5 documentation).
- Documentation of specific use cases (e.g. health care in general or eOverdracht) has been moved to the `Nuts wiki <https://wiki.nuts.nl>`_.

The following features have also been changed:

HTTP interface
==============

The HTTP interface has been reworked to make deployments simpler and more secure:

- No more dynamic binding of endpoints to ports, endpoints are now bound to the internal interface (`8081`) or the public interface (`8080`).
- Server-side TLS for HTTP has been dropped, since the Nuts node is always expected to be deployed behind a reverse proxy/ingress that handles TLS termination.
- API authentication is now only applied to `/internal` endpoints, since those are the only API endpoints that should be protected with authentication.
- CORS support has been removed. As it is only required by user authentication endpoints that are considered to be deprecated, CORS headers can be set by a reverse proxy if still required.

Port configuration
------------------
To simplify HTTP configuration and proxying and make the default more secure, HTTP endpoints now map to 2 HTTP interfaces:

- port `8081` for all internal-facing endpoints (`/internal`, `/status`, `/metrics`, `/health`)
- port `8080` for all public-facing endpoints (all others)

The new HTTP configuration reflects this,

Note that `8081` by default maps to `127.0.0.1` only, so you might need to configure it to allow it to be accessible from other machines.

************************

Release date: 2023-07-24

Fixed versioning issue.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-node/compare/v5.4.0...v5.4.1

************************
Hazelnut update (v5.4.0)
************************

Release date: 2023-07-20

New features:
- Introduced support for issuing and receiving credentials over OpenID4VCI (OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credential Issuance).
  If the node's ``/n2n`` endpoint runs on port 443, the node will automatically configure its DIDs for OpenID4VCI support.
  If running on another port, additional action is required. See :ref:`openid4vci` for more information.
- Added certificate info to peer diagnostics.
- Added last connection error and the date/time of the next connection attempt to the network's address book.

Bug fixes/improvements:
- Diagnostics now shows correct number of owned conflicted DID document (``vdr.conflicted_did_documents.owned_count``).
- Added background job that periodically checks the node's network state and fixes incorrect XOR hashes.
  This can happen in certain high-load cases on Redis.
- Network peer authentication failures are now logged on debug instead of warn, leading to less chatter.
  To find out what error occurred, you should now look at the network's address book. /internal/network/v1/addressbook
- When creating new DID documents, the VDR now checks whether the specified controllers actually exist.
- Helm chart got updated (@henk-hofs-pink).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-node/compare/v5.3.0...v5.4.0

************************
Hazelnut update (v5.3.2)
************************

Release date: 2023-08-20

- Fixed issue where NutsEmployeeCredentials needed to be explicitly trusted when issued by another node

************************
Hazelnut update (v5.3.1)
************************

Release date: 2023-06-13

- Fixed issue where a Reprocess failed due to missing data

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-node/compare/v5.3.0...v5.3.1

************************
Hazelnut update (v5.3.0)
************************

Release date: 2023-05-26

- Automatically resolving of node DIDs has been removed, since it caused more confusion than it simplified things.
  It was only meant for workshop/demo purposes and not allowed in strict mode, so the impact should be very limited.
  If you didn't configure a node DID but do want to exchange private credentials,
  you now have to configure it explicitly using `network.nodedid`.
- The ``tls.crl.maxvaliditydays`` config flag has been deprecated. CRLs are now updated more frequently, making this option obsolete.
- Adds support for RFC019 and RFC020, which describe a new EmployeeIdentity authentication means which allows an employer to make claims
  about the identity of their employees. This has a lower level of assurance, but can be used when parties trust each others employee enrollment process.
- Fixed issue where VDR could no longer update broken DID Documents.
- Added API calls to _Didman_ to update endpoints and compound services (previously, they had to be deleted and then recreated to change them).
- NutsAuthorizationCredentials and NutsOrganizationCredentials now require a valid ``credentialSubject.id`` (meaning it is a DID).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-node/compare/v5.2.0...v5.3.0

************************
Hazelnut update (v5.2.3)
************************

Release date: 2023-06-13

- Fixed issue where a Reprocess failed due to missing data

************************
Hazelnut update (v5.2.2)
************************

Release date: 2023-05-16

- Fixed issue where VDR could no longer update broken DID Documents.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-node/compare/v5.2.1...v5.2.2

************************
Hazelnut update (v5.2.1)
************************

Release date: 2023-05-08

- A ```NutsOrganizationCredential``` with an invalid ```credentialSubject.id``` could cause Didman's ```SearchOrganizations```
  call to fail. This is now fixed by ignoring invalid credentials.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-node/compare/v5.2.0...v5.2.1

************************
Hazelnut update (v5.2.0)
************************

Release date: 2023-04-25

- Some VDR OpenAPI operations specified ``application/json+did-document`` as Content-Type, while they actually returned ``application/json``.
  This inconsistency is fixed by changing the OpenAPI specification to ``application/json``.
- Diagnostics now show the conflicted document count for DID Documents the node controls. See monitoring documentation for more detail.
- ``network.connections.outbound_connectors`` on ``/status/diagnostics`` has been moved to ``/internal/network/v1/addressbook``.
  Previously it showed only failing connections, now it shows all addresses it will try to connect to (regardless it's already connected to them or not).
- Added support for encrypting documents using the JWE standard (for DIDComm support).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-node/compare/v5.1.0...v5.2.0

************************
Hazelnut update (v5.1.2)
************************

Release date: 2023-06-13

- Fixed issue where a Reprocess failed due to missing data

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-node/compare/v5.1.1...v5.1.2

************************
Hazelnut update (v5.1.1)
************************

Release date: 2023-05-16

- Fixed issue where VDR could no longer update broken DID Documents.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-node/compare/v5.1.0...v5.1.1

*************************
Hazelnut release (v5.1.0)
*************************

Release date: 2023-03-15

- Default value of strictmode changed to true.
- Introduced new HTTP-based crypto backend, which allows integration of other key storage backends.
  It uses a separate service (like a sidecar in Kubernetes) which implements a standardized API.
  The feature is still experimental, but will become the recommended backend for storing private keys in the next major release.
  See `Storage Configuration <https://nuts-node.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/deployment/storage-configuration.html#external-store-api>`_ for more information.
- Fixed situations in which parallel updates of a DID documents lead to the node not being able to process certain DID documents,
  leading to the node not being able to receive new transactions. This situation is recognizable by the following error:
  ``unable to verify transaction signature, can't resolve key by TX ref`` (note there are other cases this error can occur).
  This typically happened when one of the parallel updates removes keys from a DID document (e.g. deactivation).
- Internal storage of VDR has changed. A migration will run at startup. If the node is stopped during this process, DID Documents will have to be reprocessed manually (restore functionality)
- Added audit logging for cryptographic operations (creating a new key pair, signing, decrypting).
  Refer to the documentation for more information.
- Added new API authentication method, in which the administrator configures authorized public keys and the API client is responsible for signing JWT using the private key. This new API authentication is preferred over the current method, which will be removed in the next major release.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-node/compare/v5.0.0...v5.1.0

================
Breaking changes
================

There are no breaking changes, but if you're running in non-strict mode (but didn't actively disable it), you'll have to disable strict mode by setting ``strictmode`` to ``false``.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-node/compare/v5.0.0...v5.0.1

*****************
Coconut (v5.0.0)
*****************

Release date: 2022-11-08

- HTTPS TLS offloading is now also possible at the Nuts node. Checkout the docs on TLS offloading for the details.
  By default this is turned off which corresponds to the current behaviour.
- Issuing a Verifiable Credential will now fail when it includes a property not defined in its JSON-LD context(s).
  The behavior was changed because undefined fields are not secured by the JSON-LD proof,
  which allows an attacker to alter it while the developer assumes it is secured by the signature.
  It also helps developers noticing they misspelled a property, which it previously accepted but may have caused issues at processing systems downstream.
- Redis Sentinel is now configured through configuration parameters, rather than via the Redis connection URL as introduced in v4.
  This is done to improve documentation and reduce complexity.
- Searching VCs (using REST API) now requires a wildcard to do a partial (prefix) search on strings.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-node/compare/v4.0.0...v5.0.0

================
Breaking changes
================

**NutsAuthorizationCredential LegalBase**
When issuing Verifiable Credentials, now all fields must be defined in its context(s). This impacts the issuance of NutsAuthorizationCredentials:
Nuts RFC014 (Authorization Credential) required ``legalBase`` to be present in all ``NutsAuthorizationCredential``\s,
but this property was missing in the Nuts v1 JSON-LD context.
Since it can't simply be added afterwards, it (``legalBase``) is removed altogether.
This means, starting this version, the ``legalBase`` property can't used in new v1 ``NutsAuthorizationCredential``\s.

**Redis Sentinel**
Redis Sentinel was configured through a Redis connection URL by passing Sentinel-specific query parameters,
which has been replaced with structured configuration. To use Redis Sentinel in v5 move the following connection URL parameters to configuration:

- ``sentinelMasterName`` becomes ``storage.redis.sentinel.master``
- comma-separated Sentinel hosts become a list of hosts as ``storage.redis.sentinel.nodes``
  If using a Redis connection URL, its host won't be used set, so set the host to any irrelevant value.
- ``sentinelUsername`` becomes ``storage.redis.sentinel.username``
- ``sentinelPassword`` becomes ``storage.redis.sentinel.password``

**Searching VCs**
Before v5, searching for VCs would use partial (prefix) matching for strings by default.
Starting v5 it will use exact matching on strings by default. To match on a prefix (string starting with a specific value), add an asterisk (``*``) at the end of the string.
To match for a non-nil string, use just an asterisk (``*``) meaning anything will match (but it must be present).

***********************
Coconut update (v4.3.1)
***********************

Release date: 2022-11-30

This patch release fixes the following:

- Synchronize calls to DIDMan to avoid parallel calls from clients creating conflicted DID documents

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-node/compare/v4.3.0...v4.3.1

************************
Chestnut update (v4.3.0)
************************

Release date: 2022-10-27

This update adds forward compatibility with the upcoming v5 release.
It removes validation of ``legalBase`` from ``NutsAuthorizationCredential``, which was never properly defined in the JSON-LD contexts.
The upcoming v5 release will refuse to issue credentials with fields that were not defined in the credential's context.
But, since ``legalBase`` is required up until v4.3.0, it would mean future ``NutsAuthorizationCredentials`` issued by upcoming v5 can't be used in v4.
Hence, the removal of the validation, to become forwards compatible with v5.

See https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-node/issues/1580 for more information

Cashew (v3.0.0)
***************

Release date: 2022-06-01

This release no longer contains the V1 network protocol.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-node/compare/v2.0.0...v3.0.0

***************
Brazil (v2.0.0)
***************

Release date: 2022-04-29

This version implements the V2 network protocol. The V2 network protocol combines gossip style messages with a fast reconciliation protocol for larger difference sets.
The protocol can quickly identify hundreds of missing transactions.
The new protocol is much faster than the old protocol and its performance is currently limited by the database performance.

Besides the improved network protocol, this version also implements semantic searching for Verifiable Credentials.
Till this version, searching for VCs only supported the NutsOrganizationCredential and NutsAuthorizationCredential. With the new semantic search capabilities all kinds of credentials can be issued and found.
This is the first step for the Nuts node to become a toolbox that supports multiple domains.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-node/compare/v1.0.0...v2.0.0

***************
Almond (v1.0.0)
***************

Release date: 2022-04-01
