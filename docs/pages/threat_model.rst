Threat Model
############

The list belows follows the `STRIDE <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security)>`_ methodology of identifying threats.

.. note::

     Arguing whether a specific threat falls in category X or Y is time wasted: many fall in more than one category,
     and it's not meant as a perfect taxonomy. Focus on finding threats instead.

Threats can be handled in 3 ways:

- Mitigated (e.g. by fixing bugs)
- Eliminated (e.g. by eliminating a feature)
- Accepted
