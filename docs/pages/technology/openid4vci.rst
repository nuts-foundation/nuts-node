OpenID 4 Verifiable Credential Issuance
#######################################

Nuts supports using `OpenID 4 Verifiable Credential Issuance (OpenID4VCI) <https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html>`_
to issue credentials directly from an issuer to a holder. By supporting this protocol we aim to improve compliance with industry standards and products
and remove credentials from the network DAG.

.. note::

    This functionality is experimental and subject to change.
    We encourage developers to test it out and provide feedback.

We currently only support the issuer initiated, pre-authorized code flow,
without PIN (since the issuance is server-to-server, without user involvement).

Further support leads from what Nuts supports, meaning:

- Only ``did:nuts`` DIDs are supported
- Only JSON-LD credentials are supported

We aim to support other flows and features in future:

- Authorization code and dynamic credential requests, when we want to support flows in which the holder requests issuance of a credential
- Client authentication, depending on evolving security requirements.

Enabling
********

.. note::

    These steps to enable OpenID4VCI are subject to change.

By default, the feature is disabled.

To enable issuing and receiving credentials over OpenID4VCI:

- set ``vcr.oidc4vci.enabled`` to ``true``
- set ``vcr.oidc4vci.url`` to the base URL of your node-to-node API, e.g. ``https://nutsnode.example.com/`` (excluding ``/n2n``).
  This will typically be base URL of the ``auth.publicurl`` configuration.

To receive credentials over OpenID4VCI for a DID, you also have to register your wallet metadata URL on its DID document.
You do so by registering a service of type ``oidc4vci-wallet-metadata`` with the ``serviceEndpoint`` pointing to the wallet metadata URL,
e.g.: ``https://example.com/n2n/identity/<did>/.well-known/openid-credential-wallet``
(make sure to replace ``example.com`` and ``<did>`` with the correct values). The rest of the URL is dictated by the Nuts node.
