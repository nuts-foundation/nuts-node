JSON-LD
#######

`JSON Linked Data (JSON-LD) <https://json-ld.org/>`_ is a lightweight Linked Data format. It is easy for humans to read and write.
It is based on the already successful JSON format and provides a way to help JSON data interoperate at Web-scale.
JSON-LD is an ideal data format for programming environments, REST Web services, and unstructured databases.

Within Verifiable Credentials, JSON-LD is used to convert it to a normalized document. Normalization is required for proof generation and validation.
