Issuing and searching Verifiable Credentials
############################################

Issuing VCs
***********

As a node, you can issue credentials with each DID you control (whether they are trusted is a different story).
A credential is issued through the API.
The node will add sensible defaults for:

- id
- issuanceDate
- proof

You are required to provide the ``credentialSubject``, the ``issuer``, the ``type`` and an optional ``@context`` and ``expirationDate``.
If you do not pass a `@context`, it'll be set: ``["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1", "https://nuts.nl/credentials/v1"]``.
Note that this default does not include the latest version of the Nuts JSON-LD context.
The latest Nuts JSON-LD context can be found :ref:`here <jsonld>`.

Calling `/internal/vcr/v2/issuer/vc` with

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "issuer": "did:nuts:ByJvBu2Ex21tNdn5s8FBnqmRBTCGkqRHms5ci7gKM8rg",
        "type": "NutsOrganizationCredential",
        "credentialSubject": {
            "id": "did:nuts:9UKf9F9sRtiq4gR3bxfGQAeARtJeU8jvPqfWJcFP6ziN",
            "organization": {
                "name": "Because we care B.V.",
                "city": "IJbergen"
            }
        },
        "visibility": "public"
    }

Will be expanded by the node to:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        "https://nuts.nl/credentials/v1"
      ],
      "credentialSubject": {
        "id": "did:nuts:9UKf9F9sRtiq4gR3bxfGQAeARtJeU8jvPqfWJcFP6ziN",

        "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
        "type": "JsonWebSignature2020",
        "verificationMethod": "did:nuts:ByJvBu2Ex21tNdn5s8FBnqmRBTCGkqRHms5ci7gKM8rg#gSEtbS2dOsS9PSrV13RwaZHz3Ps6OTI14GvLx8dPqgQ"
      },
      "type": [
        "NutsOrganizationCredential",
        "VerifiableCredential"
      ]
    }

The `visibility` property indicates the contents of the VC are published on the network, so it can be read by everyone.

By default, the node will create credentials in JSON-LD format.
You can specify the format by passing the `format` parameter (``jwt_vc`` or ``ldp_vc``).

.. _searching-vcs:

Searching VCs
*************

You can search for VCs by providing a VC which should be used for matching in JSON-LD format.
Searching works by posting a Verifiable Credential to `/internal/vcr/v2/search` that contains fields to match.
The operation yields an array containing the matched verifiable credentials.

The example below searches for a `NutsOrganizationCredential` (note that the `query` field contains the credential):

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "query": {
            "@context": [
                "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
                "https://nuts.nl/credentials/v1"
            ],
            "type": ["VerifiableCredential" ,"NutsOrganizationCredential"],
            "credentialSubject": {
                "id": "did:nuts:SKUYYi2g88ohjhiu49Q13ZWGXvp678sjNiM7UHUCMyw",
                "organization": {
                    "name": "Because we care B.V.",
                    "city": "IJbergen"
                }
            }
        }
    }

Note the fields `@context` and `type`, these are required for making it a valid VC in JSON-LD.
In the example above they also contain Nuts specific contexts and types (since we're searching for a Nuts VC).
The fields `@context` and `type` are not used as query parameters for searching, they are required to determine the right context.
The following query does not return all `NutsOrganizationCredential` but **all** credentials.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "query": {
            "@context": [
                "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
                "https://nuts.nl/credentials/v1"
            ],
            "type": ["VerifiableCredential" ,"NutsOrganizationCredential"],
        }
    }

To find certain credentials, you'll need to add fields that are required to exist in the desired credential.
By default, matching is exact: it only returns the result when the given value exactly matches.
There are 2 other matchers for strings:
- ``"*"`` to match credential fields that contain the field (non-empty)
- ``*`` as postfix to match credential fields that start with the given string, e.g. ``Hospital Amst*``
When ``*`` is used anywhere else in the string it won't be interpreted as wildcard and matched as-is.
Wildcards are not supported for other types than strings.

The following example showcases both matchers:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "query": {
            "@context": [
                "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
                "https://nuts.nl/credentials/v1"
            ],
            "type": ["VerifiableCredential" ,"NutsOrganizationCredential"],
            "credentialSubject": {
                "organization": {
                    "name": "Hospital Amst*",
                    "city": "*"
                }
            }
        }
    }

By default only VCs from trusted issuers are returned. You can specify the `searchOptions` field to include VCs from untrusted issuers.
