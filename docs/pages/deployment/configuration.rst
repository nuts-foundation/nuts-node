Configuration
#############

.. marker-for-readme

The Nuts node can be configured using a YAML configuration file, environment variables and commandline params.

The parameters follow the following convention:
``$ nuts --parameter X`` is equal to ``$ NUTS_PARAMETER=X nuts`` is equal to ``parameter: X`` in a yaml file.

Or for this piece of yaml

.. code-block:: yaml

    nested:
        parameter: X

is equal to ``$ nuts --nested.parameter X`` is equal to ``$ NUTS_NESTED_PARAMETER=X nuts``

Config parameters for engines are prepended by the ``engine.ConfigKey`` by default (configurable):

.. code-block:: yaml

    engine:
        nested:
            parameter: X

is equal to ``$ nuts --engine.nested.parameter X`` is equal to ``$ NUTS_ENGINE_NESTED_PARAMETER=X nuts``

While most options are a single value, some are represented as a list (indicated with the square brackets in the table below).
To provide multiple values through flags or environment variables you can separate them with a comma (``var1,var2``).
If you need to provide an actual value with a comma, you can escape it with a backslash (``\,``) to avoid it having split into multiple values.

Ordering
********

Command line parameters have the highest priority, then environment variables, then parameters from the configfile and lastly defaults.
The location of the configfile is determined by the environment variable ``NUTS_CONFIGFILE`` or the commandline parameter ``--configfile``. If both are missing the default location ``./nuts.yaml`` is used. ::

    CLI > ENV > Config File > Defaults

Server options
**************

The following options can be configured on the server:

.. marker-for-config-options

.. note::

    did:nuts/gRPC network-related configuration options are not shown in this documentation version.
    Refer to the Nuts node v5 documentation for documentation on those configuration options.

.. include:: server_options.rst

This table is automatically generated using the configuration flags in the core and engines. When they're changed
the options table must be regenerated using the Makefile:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make docs

Secrets
*******

All options ending with ``token`` or ``password`` are considered secrets and can only be set through environment variables or the config file.

Strict mode
***********

Several of the server options above allow the node to be configured in a way that is unsafe for production environments, but are convenient for testing or development.
The node can be configured to run in strict mode (default) to prevent any insecure configurations.
Below is a summary of the impact ``strictmode=true`` has on the node and its configuration.

Save storage of any private key material requires some serious consideration.
For this reason the ``crypto.storage`` backend must explicitly be set.

Private transactions can only be exchanged over authenticated nodes.
Therefore is requires TLS to be configured through ``tls.{certfile,certkeyfile,truststore}``.
To verify that authentication is correctly configured on your node, check the ``network.auth_config`` status on the ``/health`` endpoint.
See :ref:`getting started <configure-node>` on how to set this up correctly.

The incorporated `IRMA server <https://irma.app/docs/irma-server/#production-mode>`_ is automatically changed to production mode.
In fact, running in strict mode is the only way to enable IRMA's production mode.
In addition, it requires ``auth.irma.schememanager=pbdf``.

As a general safety precaution ``auth.contractvalidators`` ignores the ``dummy`` option if configured,
requesting an access token from another node on ``/n2n/auth/v1/accesstoken`` does not return any error details,
``auth.accesstokenlifespan`` is always 60 seconds, ``http.default.cors.origin`` does not allow a wildcard (``*``),
json-ld context can only be downloaded from trusted domains configured in ``jsonld.contexts.remoteallowlist``,
and the ``internalratelimiter`` is always on.

Interacting with remote Nuts nodes requires HTTPS: it will refuse to connect to plain HTTP endpoints when in strict mode.
