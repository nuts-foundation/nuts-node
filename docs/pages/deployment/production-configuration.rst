Configuring for Production
##########################

Running a Nuts node in a production environment has additional requirements regarding security and data integrity
compared to development or test environments. This page instructs how to :ref:`configure <nuts-node-config>`
your node for running in a production environment and what to consider.

Persistence
***********

Make sure your :ref:`storage configuration <storage-configuration>` is set up to :ref:`backup your node's data and private keys <backup-restore>`.

HTTP Interface Configuration
****************************

By default all HTTP endpoints get bound to the default HTTP interface on ``:1323``.
You can configure endpoints to have alternative configuration (e.g. CORS, TLS, authentication) and/or be bound on an alternative port using the ``alt`` property.
All configuration properties that apply to the ``http.default`` HTTP interface are applicable to the alternative interface you configure as well (see the example below).

For production there are a few points to consider; enabling CORS, using alternative HTTP interfaces, and authentication.

Binding HTTP interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some HTTP endpoints are required to be accessible by the public and others only meant for administrator or your own XIS.
You can determine the intended public by observing the first part of the URL:

* Endpoints that start with ``/public`` should be accessible by the general public,
* ``/internal`` is meant for XIS application integration and administrators.

It's advisable to make sure internal endpoints aren't reachable from public networks.
You can achieve this by binding it to a different port, by using a reverse proxy, or both.
Use the ``address`` property of a HTTP binding to expose it on a different port:

.. code-block:: yaml

    http:
      # The following is the default binding which endpoints are bound to,
      # which don't have an alternative bind specified under ``alt``. Since it's a default it can be left out or
      # be used to override the default bind address.
      # If you specify an alt bind without address, it binds to the default HTTP interface, but
      # the configuration of the default bind will NOT apply to the alt bind. If required, you need to repeat the config (e.g. cors/auth) for the alt bind.
      default:
        address: :1323
      alt:
        # The following binds all endpoints starting with ``/internal`` to ``internal.lan:1111``
        internal:
          address: internal.lan:1111
          auth:
            type: token_v2
            authorizedkeyspath: /opt/nuts-node/authorized_keys
            audience: nuts-node.company.com
        # The following binds all endpoints starting with ``/public`` to ``:443`` and enables TLS for it
        public:
          address: :443
          # Given we bind on port 443, we probably want to enable TLS for this endpoint
          tls: server
          # The following enables cross-domain requests (CORS) from irma.vendor.nl
          cors:
            origin:
              - irma.vendor.nl

Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some deployments CORS can be required for the public IRMA authentication endpoints when the user-facing
authentication page is hosted on a (sub)domain that differs from Nuts Node's IRMA backend. CORS can be enabled on a
specific HTTP interface by specifying the domains allowed to make CORS requests as ``cors.origin`` (see the example above).
Although you can enable CORS on the default endpoint it's not advised to do so in a production environment,
because CORS itself opens up new attack vectors on node administrators.

Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You should secure some HTTP endpoints (notably ``/internal``) with authentication.
The Nuts node supports JWT Bearer Token authentication which can be enabled on any HTTP endpoint.
You can enable it by setting ``auth.type`` (see example above) to ``token_v2`` for the specific bind.
The specified path, and all its subpaths, will then require a JWT token generated by an external
process and signed with a trusted private/public keypair.

The optional ``auth.audience`` parameter sets the expected audience value for JWT tokens. The default value for
this parameter is determined by the hostname configured on the nuts node, and thus administrators may wish to
explicitly set this parameter when using reverse proxies or under other circumstances where the known DNS name
of the nuts node differs from its hostname.

Users are authorized access to APIs by the administrator of the nuts node. The administrator must configure the
public key of API callers in an ``authorized_keys`` file as specified in the ``auth.type.authorizedkeyspath`` setting.
This file should contain one or more trusted keys, in the standard SSH format. ECDSA, Ed25519, and RSA (>=2048-bit) keys
are accepted. Each line in the file must contain the key-type, key-specification, and user name that is authorized,
for example ``ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIH1VNKtThJiI6c5zjLn/6EjRq1PtfM4qw4HM71zivIVn john.doe@company.com``.
Note that this file should be a distinct ``authorized_keys`` file from that used to grant console access to the
nuts node. API access and SSH access are two entirely different matters and we are simply using this well known
configuration file format. The nuts node does not integrate in any way with the SSH subsystem on the host OS.

The Nuts foundation provides a utility for generating JWT tokens `on our GitHub <https://github.com/nuts-foundation/jwt-generator>`_. Unlike the legacy authentication method this tool does not need to be executed on the nuts node itself.

Alternatively, developers and integrators may choose to implement their own JWT generation process which must conform
to the requirements described in :ref:`Custom JWT Generation <api-authentication>`.

authorized_keys files
---------------------
The keys permitted to issue and sign JWT bearer tokens are specified in the authorized_keys format.


authorized_keys files are made up of multiple lines like this, each line specifying one more key/user that is authorized. For more information on the authorized_keys format see the ``AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT`` section of the `man page <http://man.he.net/man5/authorized_keys>_`.

Adding PEM files to authorized_keys
-----------------------------------

To generate the authorized_keys format from an RSA or ECDSA PEM file use the following command:
``ssh-keygen -y -f /path/to/private.pem``

For ECDSA keys you will see something like the following:
``ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBAPwLGkaO5dWEx29sW4xnmv/s8+Nzj3mnkY6SX9Qnb91oyPayZV8Ts3TXSMKlkyYHVcIz/nAxRgxgKBTMwZc2wE=``

For RSA keys you will see something like the following:
``ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQCySRpyEQwIQmf6vd+uJk54aiS7VDhbtTIMNfTRLbY1eZ+FeFsf1mbDMqsMYjwp0oBlcCL2sUrBBcsJLnHLOiT3rpziknv0kHHSTuv2sbIuHKGsVtNBtWcMMp6q56VRqfPkwa4okSde1o8hCaBUG5S3a3LA8fPWOWzpbvboY/rWeWmCNhAeaL3Koo01W5G1kC6K1mBe2ZPye6F/Q9geGTCx4GBDwDP0jp5qkpu8kf3PxlP452VZGH+pXvCffXzb/MFGBvP4N29eUANWpZed8PnJqcTlxLTTHZSkZlUn/T3U9us/Uf38nHhtZsnz3YKM+tJnBHcono8QItgKMz+tK+p5I7IBD+oyYdQ2qFJBCCUJWFnxaJfxRUG//ar1OjorVtoqHTh8mM/Q0yXEcHAfYzjHOgeyUUk34oxy4ormvmLOOx2KxEYFGJL+asbN0SaV+OS6LTZ6sySNjumYYCDJ/Mi7PROF2q2C+YmybdN85+J2t15aMxLqebJWRJHrMrZ87cfDgSrW6bm7gJqmKPNiuROubYyBYusZCznaouZRyCZ9Fa1T4o2fYrESpUCqvQaypcN5K7d94vDjvvRhid1YGGgzmlqCRDi/+70GC+tMcmA/Zn/uSlegyK2XfF1YFhCQDKM1WtMEii2wkT8jqB46AbfsTSuIvySPL5F9uZFp7wzkxw==``

To authorize these keys create a new text file or open an existing authorized_keys file and on a new line place the exported format above followed by a space and then the username or application name which is trusted to use the key (usually specified by email address):
``ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBAPwLGkaO5dWEx29sW4xnmv/s8+Nzj3mnkY6SX9Qnb91oyPayZV8Ts3TXSMKlkyYHVcIz/nAxRgxgKBTMwZc2wE= developer@company.com``

The above ssh-keygen command unfortunately fails for Ed25519 PEM keys at the time of this writing due to a `bug <https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3195>`_ and poor recent support for Ed25519 in libcrypto packages. The nuts-jwt-generator method below is recommended until this bug is fixed.

Adding JWK or PEM files to authorized_keys using nuts-jwt-generator
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To convert RSA, ECDSA, and Ed25519 keys stored in JWK or PEM files to the authorized_keys format the `nuts-jwt-generator <https://github.com/nuts-foundation/jwt-generator>`_ tool may be used.

The following command generates the authorized_keys representation from a JWK or PEM key:
``nuts-jwt-generator -i /path/to/private.pem -export-authorized-key``

This will generate output like the following:
``ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIAwaOa7iN1gnKEfiZAA7lhu3SIvfdzYE3VbswsVUQP7F``

Legacy Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This authenticaion method has been superceded and users should consider updating their deployments.

You might want to secure some HTTP endpoints (notably ``/internal``) with authentication.
The Nuts node supports JWT Bearer Token authentication which can be enabled on any HTTP endpoint.
You can enable it by setting ``auth.type`` (see example above) to ``token`` for the specific bind.
The specified path, and its all subpaths, will then require a JWT token generated by the Nuts node.
You can generate a token using the following command, which needs to be executed on the Nuts node itself:

 .. code-block:: shell

    nuts http gen-token admin 365

This command generates a token for a user named "admin" which is valid for 365 days. The user's name is used for logging HTTP requests.
It outputs the token, which should be passed using ``--token`` or ``--token-file`` when performing CLI operations or as ``Authorization`` Bearer token header for other clients, such as XIS applications.
You can also save it to a file named ``.nuts-client.cfg`` in your user's home directory, which will be read by CLI when no other token flags are passed.
See the server configuration and CLI command reference for more information.

Diagnostics
***********

To aid problem diagnosis every node in a network should share some information about itself; the type and version of software it's running,
which peers it is connected to and how long it's been up. This helps others diagnosing issues when others experience communication problems with your, and other nodes.
Although discouraged, this can be disabled by specifying ``0`` for ``network.v2.diagnosticsinterval``.

Monitoring Harmful Activity
***************************

Deployment should monitor incoming traffic for potentially harmful activity,
e.g. excessive amounts of valid requests, or requests that generate lots of errors.
This could be caused by a malicious actor (trying to cause denial of service or trying to gain access to the system's data),
but it could also be caused by a bug in a client application (e.g. XIS/EHR) or a bug in the Nuts Node.

This is no different than monitoring access to any other valued system,
so it can be solved using the existing tools to prevent (distributed) denial of service attacks and intrusion detection.

Special attention should be given to:

- the ``/public`` HTTP endpoint (because it has no authentication and is used to access IRMA sessions),
- the gRPC interface (because it allows other nodes to read/write network transactions),
- the ``/n2n`` (because it allows other to request access tokens for your systems)

Since the gRPC interface and ``/n2n`` HTTP endpoint are authenticated using the TLS client certificate,
you can monitor (and potentially deny) access to these endpoint by identifying the exact client.
