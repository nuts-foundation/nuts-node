TLS Configuration
#################

The Nuts nodes uses 2 kinds of connections: HTTP and gRPC. gRPC connections and some HTTP endpoints require TLS to be set up,
either for being able to connect to other nodes and/or secure access to the local Nuts node.
You can review these requirements in the :ref:`Interfaces/Endpoints section of the deployment documentation <nuts-node-recommended-deployment>`.

Generally speaking:

* Connections between Nuts nodes (gRPC and HTTP on `/n2n`) are secured using mutual TLS (both client and server present a X.509 certificate).
  This must be a certificate issued by a Certificate Authority which is trusted by the other nodes in the network.
* Connections from the "outside world" (HTTP on `/public`), e.g. mobile devices, are secured using TLS with only a server certificate.
  This must be a publicly trusted certificate, e.g. issued by Let's Encrypt.

.. note::

    The Nuts node currently does not support configuring multiple TLS certificates, meaning you MUST offload TLS
    using a reverse proxy (with 2 different certificates) if your users authenticate on the Nuts node (e.g. IRMA/Yivi/EmployeeID).
    This is true for almost all use cases of the Nuts node.

Your TLS configuration depends mostly on where you `terminate the TLS connection <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS_termination_proxy>`_.
This page describes the different layouts for TLS and how to configure them.

In all layouts your node's certificate must be issued by a Certificate Authority which is trusted by the other nodes in the network.
Any case using TLS requires ``tls.certfile``, ``tls.certkeyfile`` and ``tls.truststorefile`` to be configured.

You can find working setups in the `end-2-end test suite <https://github.com/nuts-foundation/nuts-go-e2e-test>`_.

TLS Offloading
**************

In most setups TLS is terminated on a reverse proxy in front of the backend services over plain HTTP or HTTP/2 (for gRPC connections).

.. raw:: html
    :file: ../../_static/images/diagrams/network infrastructure layouts-TLS-Offloading.svg

To configure this setup your proxy needs to support HTTP/2 for gRPC traffic.
For gRPC traffic your proxy must add the TLS client certificate as request header.
The certificate can either be in PEM (Apache HTTPD/NGINX) or DER (HAProxy) format and URL encoded.

In addition to the general TLS configuration, you need to configure the following options:

* ``tls.offload`` needs to be set to ``incoming``
* ``tls.certheader`` needs to be set to the name of the header in which your proxy sets the certificate (e.g. ``X-SSl-CERT``).
  The certificate must be in PEM or base64 encoded DER format.
* Disable/remove TLS configuration for HTTP interfaces.
* Bind the ``/n2n`` and ``/public`` endpoints to specific different HTTP interfaces to avoid accidentally exposing internal HTTP endpoints.

Your Nuts node configuration could look like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    tls:
      certfile: my-certificate.pem
      certkeyfile: my-certificate.pem
      truststorefile: truststore.pem
      offload: incoming
      certheader: X-SSL-CERT
    http:
      default:
        address: :1323
      alt:
        public:
          address: :80
        n2n:
          address: :8080

The certificate and truststore will still need to be available to the Nuts node for making outbound connections.

For `NGINX <https://www.nginx.com/>`_ the proxy configuration could look as follows:

.. code-block::

    http {
        server {
          server_name nuts-grpc;
          listen                    5555 ssl;
          http2                     on;
          ssl_certificate           /etc/nginx/ssl/server.pem;
          ssl_certificate_key       /etc/nginx/ssl/key.pem;
          ssl_client_certificate    /etc/nginx/ssl/truststore.pem;
          ssl_verify_client         on;
          ssl_verify_depth          1;

          location / {
            # During synchronization of a new Nuts node it is possible that the gRPC stream contains messages larger than NGINX is willing to accept.
            # The following config disables buffering and increases the max. message a client can send to some sanely large number.
            # If not configured, NGINX will drop the connection when syncing lots of transactions at once.
            proxy_buffering off;
            client_max_body_size 128m;

            grpc_pass grpc://nuts-node:5555;
            grpc_set_header X-SSL-CERT $ssl_client_escaped_cert;        # add peer's SSL cert
            grpc_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; # for correct IP logging
          }
        }


        server {
          server_name nuts-n2n;
          listen                    443 ssl;
          ssl_certificate           /etc/nginx/ssl/server.pem;
          ssl_certificate_key       /etc/nginx/ssl/key.pem;
          ssl_client_certificate    /etc/nginx/ssl/truststore.pem;
          ssl_verify_client         on;
          ssl_verify_depth          1;

          location /n2n {
            proxy_pass http://nuts-node:8080;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; # for correct IP logging
          }
        }

        server {
          server_name nuts-public;
          listen                    443 ssl;
          ssl_certificate           /etc/nginx/ssl/server.pem;
          ssl_certificate_key       /etc/nginx/ssl/key.pem;

          location /public {
            proxy_pass http://nuts-node:80;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; # for correct IP logging
          }
        }
    }

For `HAProxy <https://www.haproxy.com/>`_ the proxy configuration could look as follows:

.. code-block::

    frontend grpc_service
        mode http
        bind :5555 proto h2 ssl crt /certificate.pem ca-file /truststore.pem verify required
        default_backend grpc_servers

    backend grpc_servers
        mode http
        option forwardfor  # for correct IP logging
        http-request set-header X-SSL-CERT %{+Q}[ssl_c_der,base64]
        server node1 nuts_node:5555 check proto h2

Revoked Certificates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Proxies should always check whether the presented client certificate is revoked, e.g. in case its private was leaked.
Many proxies don't automatically check certification revocation status unless explicitly configured.
For HAProxy and NGINX you need to download/update the CRLs yourself and configure the proxy to use it (generally achieved using a scheduled script).
This is not included in the examples above.

End-to-end TLS (no offloading)
******************************

Having no TLS offloading means the secure connection starts at the remote system and ends at the Nuts node.
No systems in between can alter or inspect the TLS connection.

.. raw:: html
    :file: ../../_static/images/diagrams/network infrastructure layouts-Direct-WAN-Connection.svg

For this setup you need to configure TLS and set up the HTTP interfaces so the endpoints are properly secured.
The example below shows how to:

* configure TLS for HTTP and gRPC connections,
* enable TLS (with required client certificate) for node-to-node (``/n2n``) HTTPS connections on port ``8443``,
* enable TLS (server certificate only) for ``/public`` HTTPS connections on port ``443``.

Your Nuts node configuration could look like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    tls:
      certfile: my-certificate.pem
      certkeyfile: my-certificate.pem
      truststorefile: truststore.pem
    http:
      default:
        address: :1323
      alt:
        public:
          address: :443
          tls: server
        n2n:
          address: :8443
          tls: server-client

.. note::

    In the example above ``/internal`` endpoints bind to the default HTTP interface, which does not apply any access control.
    To secure your node you must restrict access this endpoint, e.g. by not exposing it to the outside world.
    It's generally preferable to use an external load balancer (see "TLS Pass-through") or firewall to decrease the risk of misconfiguration of the node.
    You can bind ``/internal`` to its own HTTP interface to further decrease the risk.

TLS Pass-through
****************

When using a (level 4) load balancer that does not inspect or alter requests, TLS is still terminated on the Nuts node.

.. raw:: html
    :file: ../../_static/images/diagrams/network infrastructure layouts-TLS-Pass-through.svg

This setup does not need additional configuration.

Configuration for `HAProxy <https://www.haproxy.com/>`_ could look like this (given the TLS configuration in the previous section):

.. code-block::

    listen grpc
        bind *:5555
        mode tcp
        server node1 nodeA-backend:5555 check

    listen public
        bind *:443
        mode tcp
        server node1 nodeA-backend:443 check

    listen n2n
        bind *:8443
        mode tcp
        server node1 nodeA-backend:8443 check


Refer to the HAProxy documentation for more information.

.. note::

    In a (level 4) pass-through configuration, the Nuts node will see the load balancer as origin (IP) for all incoming connections.
