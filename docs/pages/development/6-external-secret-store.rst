Integrate with an external secret store
#######################################

.. note::

    The following functionality is experimental and subject to change. We encourage developers to test it out on a test network and provide feedback.

Motivation
**********

The Nuts-node represents entities in the network. These entities have cryptographic keys that are used to sign and encrypt data. The Nuts-node stores these keys in a secret store. The safety of the Nuts network depends on the security of these keys since the possession of the keys proofs ownership over the identity. For development purposes, the Nuts node contains a simple file based secret store. This is not recommended for production environments, and a safer alternative is advised. Since there are many different secret stores, the Nuts-node has been designed to be able to integrate with any secret store. This is done by using a proxy that acts as a bridge between the node and secret store. The Nuts-node communicates with this proxy using a standardised API. This way, the Nuts-node can be configured to use any secret store.

Implementing a proxy or building a custom secret store
******************************************************

A proxy or secret store should implement the Nuts Secret store API specification. This OpenAPI specification is available on `GitHub <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nuts-foundation/Nuts-node/master/docs/_static/crypto/Nuts-storage-api-v1.yaml>`__.

Consider developing your implementation under an open source license and publish it on a collaborative version control website such as `GitHub <https://github.com>`__ or `Gitlab <https://gitlab.com>`__ so that other parties can use it.

Configuration
*************

If you want the Nuts node to use the external secret store API, you should configure the following properties:

.. code-block:: yaml

    crypto:
      storage: external
      external:
        address: https://localhost:8210

Limitations
***********

The API has a few limitations:

- It does not yet support authentication. This means that the proxy should be secured in such a way that only the Nuts node can access the API.

Available external storage implementations
******************************************

The following list contains all the known implementations of the Nuts external store API:

- `Nuts Vault proxy <https://github.com/nuts-foundation/hashicorp-vault-proxy>`__. This is a proxy that integrates with Hashicorp Vault. It uses the Vault KV store to store the keys. The proxy is developed by the Nuts foundation and is available under an open source license.
