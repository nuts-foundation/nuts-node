Running on Docker
#################

If you already use Docker, the easiest way to get your Nuts Node up and running for development or production is
using Docker. This guide helps you to configure the Nuts node in Docker.
To use the latest `master` build use `nutsfoundation/nuts-node:master` (for production environments it's advisable to use a specific version).

First determine the working directory for the Nuts node which will contain configuration and data. These which will be mounted into the Docker container.
Follow the :ref:`configuration <configure-node>` to setup the configuration of your node.

Mounts
******

Using this guide the following resources are mounted:

- Readonly PEM file with TLS certificate and private key. They can be separate but in this example they're contained in 1 file.
- Readonly PEM file with TLS truststore for the particular network you're connecting to.
- Readonly `nuts.yaml` configuration file.
- Data directory where data is stored.

Docker run
**********

If you want to run without Docker Compose you can use the following command from the working directory:

.. code-block:: shell

  docker run --name nuts -p 5555:5555 -p 1323:1323 \
    --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/certificate-and-key.pem,target=/opt/nuts/certificate-and-key.pem,readonly \
    --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/truststore.pem,target=/opt/nuts/truststore.pem,readonly \
    --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/nuts.yaml,target=/opt/nuts/nuts.yaml,readonly \
    --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/data,target=/opt/nuts/data \
    -e NUTS_CONFIGFILE=/opt/nuts/nuts.yaml \
    nutsfoundation/nuts-node:master

This setup uses the following `nuts.yaml` configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

  datadir: /opt/nuts/data
  network:
    truststorefile: /opt/nuts/truststore.pem
    certfile: /opt/nuts/certificate-and-key.pem
    certkeyfile: /opt/nuts/certificate-and-key.pem
    bootstrapnodes:
      - example.com:5555

.. note::

    The command above uses `pwd` and `bash` functions, which do not work on Windows. If running on Windows replace
    it with the path of the working directory.

You can test whether your Nuts Node is running properly by visiting `http://localhost:1323/status/diagnostics`. It should
display diagnostic information about the state of the node.

Docker Compose
**************

Copy the following YAML file and save it as `docker-compose.yaml` in the working directory.

.. code-block:: yaml

  version: "3.7"
  services:
    nuts:
      image: nutsfoundation/nuts-node:master
      environment:
        NUTS_CONFIGFILE: /opt/nuts/nuts.yaml
      ports:
        - 5555:5555
        - 1323:1323
      volumes:
        - "./certificate-and-key.pem:/opt/nuts/certificate-and-key.pem:ro"
        - "./truststore.pem:/opt/nuts/truststore.pem:ro"
        - "./nuts.yaml:/opt/nuts/nuts.yaml:ro"
        - "./data:/opt/nuts/data:rw"


Start the service:

.. code-block:: shell

  docker-compose up
