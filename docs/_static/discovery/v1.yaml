        To delete a presentation, the client should send an empty presentation that:
        * has a JWT claim 'retracted_jti' indicating the ID of the previous presentation of the same subject
        * has no credentials in it
        * has the type 'RetractedVerifiablePresentation'

      summary: Searches for presentations registered on the Discovery Service.
      description: |
        An API of the discovery client that searches for presentations on the Discovery Service,
        whose credentials match the given query parameter.
        It queries the client's local copy of the Discovery Service which is periodically synchronized with the Discovery Server.
        This means new registrations might not immediately show up, depending on the client refresh interval. 
        The query parameters are interpreted as JSON path expressions, evaluated on the verifiable credentials.
        The following features and limitations apply:
        - only simple child-selectors are supported (so no arrays selectors, script expressions etc).
        - only JSON string values can be matched, no numbers, booleans, etc.
        - wildcard (*) are supported at the start and end of the value
        - a single wildcard (*) means: match any (non-nil) value
        - matching is case-insensitive
        - expressions must not include the '$.' prefix, which is added by the API.
        - all expressions must match a single credential, for the credential to be included in the result.
        - if there are multiple credentials in the presentation, the presentation is included in the result if any of the credentials match.
        
        Valid examples:
        - `credentialSubject.givenName=John`
        - `credentialSubject.organization.city=Arnhem`
        - `credentialSubject.organization.name=Hospital*`
        - `credentialSubject.organization.name=*clinic`
        - `issuer=did:web:example.com`

        Registration of a Verifiable Presentation will be attempted immediately, and it will be automatically refreshed.
        Application only need to call this API once for every service/DID combination, until the registration is explicitly deleted through this API.
        
        For successful registration on the Discovery Server, the DID's credential wallet must contain the credentials specified by the Discovery Service definition.
        If initial registration fails this API returns the error indicating what failed, but will retry at a later moment.
        Applications can force a retry by calling this API again.
