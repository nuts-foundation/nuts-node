      description: |
        An API provided by the discovery server that adds a presentation to the service.
        The presentation must be signed by subject of the credentials it contains.
        
        To delete a presentation, the client should send an empty presentation that:
        * has a JWT claim 'retracted_jti' indicating the ID of the previous presentation of the same subject
        * has no credentials in it
        * has the type 'RetractedVerifiablePresentation'
        
        error returns:
        * 400 - incorrect input; e.g. unsupported presentation or credential type, invalid signature, unresolvable credential subject, etc.

      description: |
        An API of the discovery client that searches for presentations on the discovery service,
        whose credentials match the given query parameter.
        The query parameters are interpreted as JSON path expressions, evaluated on the verifiable credentials.
        The following features and limitations apply:
        - only simple child-selectors are supported (so no arrays selectors, script expressions etc).
        - only JSON string values can be matched, no numbers, booleans, etc.
        - wildcard (*) are supported at the start and end of the value
        - a single wildcard (*) means: match any (non-nil) value
        - matching is case-insensitive
        - expressions must not include the '$.' prefix, which is added by the API.
        - all expressions must match a single credential, for the credential to be included in the result.
        - if there are multiple credentials in the presentation, the presentation is included in the result if any of the credentials match.
        
        Valid examples:
        - `credentialSubject.givenName=John`
        - `credentialSubject.organization.city=Arnhem`
        - `credentialSubject.organization.name=Hospital*`
        - `credentialSubject.organization.name=*clinic`
        - `issuer=did:web:example.com`
