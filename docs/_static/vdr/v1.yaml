      summary: Creates a new Nuts DID
      description: |
        The DID Document will be created according to the given request. If a combination of options is not allowed, a 400 is returned.
        The default values for selfControl, assertionMethod and capabilityInvocation are true. The default for controllers is an empty list. All other options default to false.
        Only a single keypair will be generated. All enabled methods will reuse the same key pair. A seperate keypair will be generated to generate the DID if SelfControl is false.

        error returns:
        * 400 - Invalid (combination of) options
        * 500 - An error occurred while processing the request
