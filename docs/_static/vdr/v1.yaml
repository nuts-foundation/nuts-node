      description: |
        Starting with v6.0.0, the entire body will be ignored and default values will be used.
        The default values are: selfControl = true, assertionMethod = true, keyAgreement = true, capabilityInvocation = true, capabilityDelegation = true, authentication = true and controllers = [].
        
        Only a single keypair will be generated. All enabled methods will reuse the same key pair.
