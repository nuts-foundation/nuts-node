          description: |
            A string value that specifies the operational domain of a digital proof. This could be an Internet domain
            name like example.com, an ad-hoc value such as mycorp-level3-access, or a very specific transaction value
            like 8zF6T$mqP. A signer could include a domain in its digital proof to restrict its use to particular
            target, identified by the specified domain.

          type: string
          description: |
            A unique string value generated by the holder, MUST only be used once for a particular domain
            and window of time. This value can be used to mitigate replay attacks.
        verificationMethod:
          type: string
          description: |
            Specifies the public key that can be used to verify the digital signature.
            Dereferencing a public key URL reveals information about the controller of the key,
            which can be checked against the issuer of the credential.
