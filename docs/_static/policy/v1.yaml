      summary: Returns a list of presentation definitions for the given DID and scope.
      description: |
        The DID is used for tenant selection. Not all tenants will probably support the same scopes.
        The scope is used as selection criteria for the presentation definition.
        It could be the case that the presentation definition is not found.
        In that case the response will be 201 with an empty body.

            DID has been found and the scope is supported.
            If the scope is supported but no presentation definition is required, the response will be 200 with a presentation definition without any input descriptors.

      description: |
        When an access token is used to request a resource, the resource server needs to know if the access token grants access to the requested resource.
        The resource server will send a request to the policy backend to check if the access token grants access to the requested resource.
        All cryptographic and presentation exchange validations have already been done by the caller.
