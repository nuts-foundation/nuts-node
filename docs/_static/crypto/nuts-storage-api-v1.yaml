  title: Nuts Crypto Storage Abstraction API
  description: |
    API specification for a generic secret store HTTP server. 
    It can be use to implement a secure store or a proxy to a storage solution such as 
    Hashicorp Vault or Azure key store. Usually the Nuts node will be the client.
    
    The endpoints mounted at /secret act as a key-value store which accepts keys as path.

      operationId: healthCheck
      description: |
        This endpoint implements the API Health Check RFC https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-inadarei-api-health-check.
        It can be used by clients to check the availability of the services. The server should return a 200 status code if the service is available, and a 503 status code if the service is unavailable.
      responses:
        200:
          description: |
            The service is healthy
          content:
            application/health+json:
              schema:
                $ref: "#/components/schemas/ServiceStatus"
        503:
          description: |
            The service is not healthy
          content:

  /secrets:
    get:
      operationId: listKeys
      description: |
        List all the keys available in the store.
        
        In case the store is used by the Nuts node for storing private keys from DID identities,
        the Nuts-node usually calls this endpoint during startup or during a key migration.
      responses:
        200:
          description: The response contains all the keys stored on this storage engine.
