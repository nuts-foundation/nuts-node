checks:
  # Go returns 'error's rather than throwing exceptions, so the safer the code the more errors are returned.
  # To avoid deeply nested if-statements we generally use guard clauses as recommended by Martin Fowler.
  # Guard statements are if-statements that, as early as possible, check conditions and return if failed. They improve readability
  # over nested if-statements. This however leads to many return statements which can't be avoided, so we'll disable the max. exit points check.
